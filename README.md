For SVD, the function generate_all_embeddings(train_path) will generate all 9 embeddings for SVD algorithm.
There are also some lines of code to generate the result table.
The SVD results are txt files with name svd_DIMENSION_CONTEXTWINDOW.txt

If you simply run the file, all the txt results and table will be generated.
